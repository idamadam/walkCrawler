At end of housing estate is a creek crossing and sign for the park. Walk another 1-2 km until you reach another park sign and a metal post indicating the start of the walk. The path is well defined throughout although overgrown in parts. For the next 6km the path will hug the side of Moores Creek with multiple creek crossings. Take care not to lose the path when crossing the creek in the upper reaches. There is also a nice forest to walk through before the main ascent starts which has a lot vegetation when climbing the side of the mountain. Once you lose the main branch of the creek (about 7-8km) the trail will begin to ascend the mountain and cross some smaller branches of the creek with small waterfalls. The trail will then reach a ridge and subsequent lookout point with grass trees all around and view of the Beserker Ranges. The ascent is then quite easy from this point on with plenty of opportunities to take a break with rest chairs available. The walk can be frustrating at time as it follows the creek right around the base of mountain before it commences an ascent. It also has multiple minor ascent and decents on the base of the mountain which hug the creek. You think you are going to ascend only to find another creek crossing. The creek is usually flowing and very clear giving you the opportunity to fill your water bottle up at refresh at various stages before the full ascent commences. The trail is also very rocky in parts when following the creek so a high degree of care must be taken not to roll an ankle. This a challenging and sometimes demanding hike so leave plenty of time to complete.
